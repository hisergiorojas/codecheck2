echo "play.http.secret.key=\"$(head -c 32 /dev/urandom | base64)\"" > conf/production.conf
```

```Here is a guidline for naming your S3 bucket.


echo "com.horstmann.codecheck.comrun.remote=\"http://host.docker.internal:8080/api/upload\"" >> conf/production.conf
```

Update conf/production.conf


```
play.http.secret.key="see above"
com.horstmann.codecheck.comrun.remote="the URL of the comrun service"
com.horstmann.codecheck.s3.accessKey="your AWS credentials"
com.horstmann.codecheck.s3.secretKey=""
com.horstmann.codecheck.s3bucketsuffix="mybucket.mydomain.com"
com.horstmann.codecheck.s3.region=your AWS region such as "us-west-1"
com.horstmann.codecheck.repo.ext=""
```



## Create AWS S3 bucket
Create a [Amazon S3 Bucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/UsingBucket.html)

One of the option for creating a bucket is by using [AWS CLI](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/s3api/create-bucket.html)
```
aws s3api create-bucket \
    --bucket my-bucket \
    --region us-east-1
```

Follow the [guideline for naming](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/bucketnamingrules.html) your S3 bucket.
```
Bucket Name:  mybucket.mydomain.com
AWS Region: US West (N. California) us-west-1
Object Ownership: ACLs disabled
Block Public Access settings for this bucket: Off
Bucket Versioning: Disable
Default encryption: Disable
```

Open a terminal and verify that the bucket was created

```
aws s3 ls s3://<BUCKET-NAME>

aws s3 ls
```

## How to upload a test file to AWS S3 bucket using the CLI
